## Motivation

![Squid trawl](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5669f27fa128e6a7fba76540/t/568d793e25981d9e06ac19a1/1452112192471/header.jpg?format=1500w)

- Non-target species are often caught during fishing operations
- Observer programs are used to monitor this incidental catch
- Understanding of the coverage of the program and how to interpret the data is needed

```{r}

hauls = c(807, 37, 27, 8, 4, 4, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)  # from table 4.3
albatross = c(0:17)
incidental<-data.frame(albatross, hauls)
```

and let's look at the distribution by plotting a bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = incidental) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x= albatross, y = hauls), fill = "dodgerblue", colour = "black", stat = "identity") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-1,18), ylim = c(0,850), expand = FALSE) + 
  theme_bw()
```

Pseudocode 4.1
1. Specify the level of observer coverage, \\(N_{tow}\\) per simulation, and the total number of simulations \\(N_{sim}\\), and the negative binomial parameters *m* and *k*. These are estimated from last year's data. Also specifY the criterion "success," *d*, and the value of \\(t_q\\)

```{r}
albatross_all <- rep(incidental$albatross, times = incidental$hauls)
length(albatross_all)

albatross_mean = mean(albatross_all)

k = mean(albatross_all)^2/(var(albatross_all)- mean(albatross_all))
m <- albatross_mean
Ntows = 5000 #eventually we will increase this to 5000
iter = 150 # eventually we will increase this to 150
tq = 1.645

crit_success = 0.25*m
```

2. On the \\(j^{th}\\) iteration of the simulation, for the ith simulated tow, generate a level of incidental take \\(C_{ij}\\) using Equation 4.7. To do this, first generate the probability of *n* birds in the by-catch for an individual tow, then calculate the cumulative probability of *n* or fewer birds being obtained in the by-catch. Next draw a uniform random number between zero and 1, and then see where this random number falls in the cumulative distribution. Repeat this for all \\(N_{tow}\\) tows

First generate the pdf and cdf

```{r}

c = 0:100
probs <- (gamma(k + c)/(gamma(k)*factorial(c))) * ((k/(k+m))^k) * ((m/(m+k))^c)
p_c<-data.frame(c, probs)
p_c$cdf<- cumsum(p_c$probs)

ggplot(data = p_c) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x= c, y = probs), fill = "red", colour = "black", stat = "identity") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-1,101), ylim = c(0,1), expand = FALSE) + 
  labs(x="Number of birds captured", y = "pdf") +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(data = p_c) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x= c, y = cdf), fill = "green", colour = "black", stat = "identity") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-1,101), ylim = c(0,1), expand = FALSE) + 
  labs(x="Number of birds captured", y = "cdf") +
  theme_bw()

```

3. Compute the mean

$$ M_j = \frac{1}{N_{tow}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{tow}}C_{ij}$$

and the variance

$$ S_j^2 = \frac{1}{N_{tow}-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{tow}}(C_{ij} - M_j)^2  $$

on the \\(j^{th}\\) iteration of the simulation.

4. Compute the range, in analogy to Equation 4.4:
$$ (Range)_j = 2\frac{S_j}{\sqrt{N_{tow}}}t_q $$

5. If (Range) is less than the specified range criterion for success, increase the number of successes by 1. 
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for j = 1 to \\(N_{sim}\\). Estimate the probability of success when Nr.ow tows are observed by dividing the total number of successes by N_{tow}.

Start the loop.  **NOTE**:  I changed the way the loop was run from the psuedo code by nesting iterations within tows.   **NOTE**:  This simulation will take a few minutes to run.  I have run the simulations ahead of time and put them up on [github]()

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)

## Create a function that will allow us to more easily find the corresponding catch for each random number

find_catch <- function(pc,rand_val){
   id<-which(rand_val>=p_c$cdf)  # find which values are greater than or equal to our cdf
   id<-ifelse(length(id)<1,1,max(id))  # correct for if none are larger and otherwise take the max id
   return(p_c$c[id])
  }

tows <- seq(25,Ntows,by = 25)
s_stor <- data.frame(tows = tows, s = NA, iter = iter)

  for(i in 1:length(tows)){
    s = 0
    print(paste("Ntows = ",tows[i],sep = ""))
    for(j in 1:iter){
      # print(j)
      rand_uni<-runif(tows[i])  #generate j number of random uniform variables
      catch<- sapply(rand_uni, function(x) find_catch(pc,x)) # use the find_catch function to find the corresponding numbr of birds from our find_catch function
      
      M_j = mean(catch)  # Step 3 in the psuedo code
      S_j2 = var(catch)
      Range_j = 2*(sqrt(S_j2)/sqrt(tows[i]))*tq # Step 4 in the psuedo code

      s = ifelse(Range_j < crit_success & Range_j > 0, s+1,s) # Step 5 in the psuedo code
    }
  
    s_stor$s[i] <-s
  
  }

incidental<-s_stor
```

Plot the results 

```{r}
#  if reading from the github, otherwise comment this out if you are using your own simulation. 
incidental<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrischizinski/SNR_R_Group/master/data/incidental.csv")

incidental$prop <- incidental$s/incidental$iter

ggplot(data = incidental) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = tows, y = prop), size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = tows, y = prop),method = "lm", formula = y ~ splines::bs(x, 25), colour = "red",se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,1.05), xlim = c(0,5000), expand = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
  

```
