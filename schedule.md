## Course Aims
Course Description 
This course provides students with an understanding of how to apply multivariate statistical methods. Emphasis is placed on developing conceptual and practical understanding of how to apply these techniques with real-world data. While many of the examples will be with ecological data, the information is applicable to other disciplines. Topics include introduction to coding and use of the statistical program R, screening data, distance matrices, classification approaches, ordination, multivariate regression. No previous experience in R is required.

Course Objectives:

By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1.	Demonstrate a working knowledge of the coding in the statistical program R.
2.	Demonstrate a working knowledge of manipulating and summarizing data sets and producing presentation or publication graphics in R
3.	Use appropriate techniques to screen and standardize multivariate data.
4.	Use the appropriate analysis technique to identify and characterize groups in multivariate data.
5.	Use the appropriate analysis techniques in the ordination of multivariate data.
6.	Demonstrate an ability to model multivariate data using the appropriate techniques. 


This course will:

1.	Provide a forum for discussion on problem solving with R and multivariate data.
2.	Enable students to utilize approaches to evaluate questions using multivariate data
3.	Familiarize students with common R packages (e.g., psych, vegan) to conduct multivariate analysis in R
4.	Provide each student a suite of analytical and coding skills that will can be applied in graduate school and their careers.
