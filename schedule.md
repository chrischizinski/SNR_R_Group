## Course Aims
This course will follow Hilborn and Mangel's [The Ecological Detective](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5987.html).  Following the pseudo code in the book, we will use R programming for the generation of hypotheses, exploration of data, and comparison of different models. Special emphasis will be placed on checking assumptions, exploratory data analysis, presentation of results, and developing sound coding skills.  Everyone taking the course should purchase a copy of the book and should have taken a college level statistics course. 

## Material repository

Material can be found in the SNR R User group repository on [github](https://github.com/chrischizinski/SNR_R_Group) and through the group's [github page](https://chrischizinski.github.io/SNR_R_Group/)

## Books

Much of the lectures in this class will revolve around material available in these books:

> Hilborn, R. and Mangel, M., 1997. The Ecological Detective: Confronting Models with Data (Vol. 28). Princeton University Press.

and

> Aho, K. A. 2013. Foundational and applied statistics for biologists using R. CRC Press.
