Waterstrider data set.
The dataset ASILIMNO.DAT contains a dataset of 8 measurements in all 5
larval instars and the adults of the 6 species of the waterstrider 
genus Limnoporus (Insecta: Heteroptera: Gerridae). A morphometric analysis
of the data set will be published (Klingenberg & Spence, Evolution, in
press). Feel free to play around with the file as you wish, but please ask
either me (cklingen@vm.ucs.ualberta.ca) or John Spence (userrail@
mts.ucs.ualberta.ca) if you want to publish anything from it.

The species are (with phylogeny):
  L. notabilis         --------------------+
                                           |
  L. dissortis         --------------+     +-----+
                                     +-----+     |
  L. rufoscutellatus   -------+      |           |
                              +------+           |
  L. genitalis         -------+                  +-------
                                                 |
  L. esakii            --------------+           |
                                     +-----------+
  L. canaliculatus     --------------+

The variables are:
Species, instar (1-5 for larvae, 6 for adults), sex (m male, f female,
u undetermined), antseg1 - antseg4 (lengths of 1st to 4th antennal seg-
ments), midfem, midtib, hindfem, hindtib (lenghts of middle and hind
femora and tibiae).
The values are raw measurements in millimeters.

The SAS/IML routine for Common Principal Components.

The SAS/IML routine is provided with two examples (asterisks inactivate
one of them, just switch them to the other example, if you want to use
the other one. The values of the results are published in Bernard Flury's
1988 book (complete citation in the allometry handout). Before you run
the routine for research purposes, plese test it with these data (and 
maybe others).
For applying the routine to your data, you have to 'feed in' the parameters
in the appropriate matrices (see comments at the beginning of the routine).
One possibility is to use the SAS procedure CORR before you enter SAS/IML.
(Don't forget the COV option in PROC CORR!!!)
The program ALLOCPCA.SAS gives an example how to do this for ontogenetic 
allometry in the waterstrider data.

If there are any problems or questions, I will try to help you if I can. I
will be back in Edmonton and answer my E-mail from 5 September '93.

Cheers, 
Chris.
