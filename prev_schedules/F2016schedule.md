## Course Aims
This course has two principal aims: 1) to describe common experimental designs used in natural resources research and 2) provide a means to analyze experiments using R. Topics covered include linear and logistic regression, simple and complex ANOVA models (e.g., factorial, nested, block, split-plot and repeated measures and covariance designs), and log- linear models. Multivariate techniques, including classification and ordination are introduced. Emphasis will be placed on checking assumptions, exploratory data analysis, and presentation of results.

## Material repository

Material can be found in the SNR R User group repository on [github](https://github.com/chrischizinski/SNR_R_Group) and through the group's [github page](https://chrischizinski.github.io/SNR_R_Group/)

## Books

Much of the lectures in this class will revolve around material available in these books:

> Quinn, G. P.,and M. J.  Keough. 2002. Experimental design and data analysis for biologists. Cambridge University Press.

and

> Aho, K. A. 2013. Foundational and applied statistics for biologists using R. CRC Press.
