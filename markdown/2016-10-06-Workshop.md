# OFWIM Using R for Data wrangling and graphics

We will have a lot to cover in today's workshop.  As mentioned in the last webinar, we are going to be using more packages in the `tidyverse`.  The first segment we will be using two packages (`tidyr` and `dplyr`) for manipulating data sets and getting it ready to either analyze or produce graphics.  We will then explore the package `ggplot2` to create publication quality graphics.  There has been increasing movement of being able to create graphics that are interactive and used on websites.  We will explore XXX packages that will utilize R's capabilities of doing this.
