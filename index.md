Welcome to the [School of Natural Resources](http://www.snr.unl.edu) R User Group page.  We have covered a wide variety of topics including applied mutlivariate statitics, regression, ecological simulations, building Shiny apps, data wrangling, and graphics.   Our group represents faculty, postdocs, graduate students and agency personnel.  We meet Fridays 9 - 12 in Hardin Hall 141.  If you are interested in coming to one of our groups, feel free to send me an email or just come to to one of our meetings.
